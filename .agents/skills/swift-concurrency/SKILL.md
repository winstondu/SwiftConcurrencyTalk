# Swift Concurrency

## Agent Rules

1. Analyze `Package.swift` or `.pbxproj` to determine Swift language mode (5.x vs 6) and toolchain before giving advice.
2. Before proposing fixes, identify the isolation boundary: `@MainActor`, custom actor, actor instance isolation, or nonisolated.
3. Do not recommend `@MainActor` as a blanket fix. Justify why main-actor isolation is correct for the code.
4. Prefer structured concurrency (child tasks, task groups) over unstructured tasks. Use `Task.detached` only with a clear reason.
5. If recommending `@preconcurrency`, `@unchecked Sendable`, or `nonisolated(unsafe)`, require:
   - a documented safety invariant
   - a follow-up ticket to remove or migrate it
6. For migration work, optimize for minimal blast radius (small, reviewable changes) and follow the validation loop: **Build → Fix errors → Rebuild → Only proceed when clean**.
7. Course references are for deeper learning only. Use them sparingly and only when they clearly help answer the developer's question.

## Triage Checklist (Before Advising)

- Capture the exact compiler diagnostics and the offending symbol(s).
- Identify the current isolation boundary and module defaults (`@MainActor`, custom actor, default isolation).
- Confirm whether the code is UI-bound or intended to run off the main actor.

## Quick Fix Mode (Use When)

Use Quick Fix Mode when:
- The errors are localized (single file or one type) and the isolation boundary is clear.
- The fix does not require API redesign or multi-module changes.
- You can explain the fix in 1–2 steps without changing behavior.

Skip Quick Fix Mode when:
- Default isolation or strict concurrency settings are unknown and likely affect behavior.
- The error crosses module boundaries or involves public API changes.
- The fix would require `@unchecked Sendable`, `@preconcurrency`, or `nonisolated(unsafe)` without a clear invariant.

## Project Settings Intake (Evaluate Before Advising)

Concurrency behavior depends on build settings. Before advising, determine these via `Read` on `Package.swift` or `Grep` in `.pbxproj` files:

| Setting | SwiftPM (`Package.swift`) | Xcode (`.pbxproj`) |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Default isolation | `.defaultIsolation(MainActor.self)` | `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION` |
| Strict concurrency | `.enableExperimentalFeature("StrictConcurrency=targeted")` | `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY` |
| Upcoming features | `.enableUpcomingFeature("NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault")` | `SWIFT_UPCOMING_FEATURE_*` |
| Language mode | `// swift-tools-version:` at top | Swift Language Version build setting |

If any of these are unknown, ask the developer to confirm them before giving migration-sensitive guidance.

## Smallest Safe Fixes (Quick Wins)

Prefer edits that preserve behavior while satisfying data-race safety.

- **UI-bound types**: isolate the type or specific members to `@MainActor` (justify why UI-bound).
- **Global/static mutable state**: move into an `actor` or isolate to `@MainActor` if UI-only.
- **Background work**: for work that should always hop off the caller’s isolation, move expensive work into an `async` function marked `@concurrent`; for work that doesn’t touch isolated state but can inherit the caller’s isolation (for example with `NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault`), use `nonisolated` without `@concurrent`, or use an `actor` to guard mutable state.
- **Sendable errors**: prefer immutable/value types; avoid `@unchecked Sendable` unless you can prove and document thread safety.

## Quick Fix Playbook (Common Diagnostics -> Minimal Fix)

- **"Main actor-isolated ... cannot be used from a nonisolated context"**
  - Quick fix: if UI-bound, make the caller `@MainActor` or hop with `await MainActor.run { ... }`.
  - Escalate if this is non-UI code or causes reentrancy; use `references/actors.md`.
- **"Actor-isolated type does not conform to protocol"**
  - Quick fix: add isolated conformance (e.g., `extension Foo: @MainActor SomeProtocol`).
  - Escalate if the protocol requirements must be `nonisolated`; use `references/actors.md`.
- **"Sending value of non-Sendable type ... risks causing data races"**
  - Quick fix: confine access inside an actor or convert to a value type with immutable (`let`) state.
  - Escalate before `@unchecked Sendable`; use `references/sendable.md` and `references/threading.md`.
- **Linter `async_without_await`**
  - Quick fix: remove `async` if not required; if required by protocol/override/@concurrent, use narrow suppression with rationale. See `references/linting.md`.
- **"wait(...) is unavailable from asynchronous contexts" (XCTest)**
  - Quick fix: use `await fulfillment(of:)` or Swift Testing equivalents. See `references/testing.md`.

## Escalation Path (When Quick Fixes Aren't Enough)

1. Gather project settings (default isolation, strict concurrency level, upcoming features).
2. Re-evaluate isolation boundaries and which types cross them.
3. Use the decision tree + references for the deeper fix.
4. If behavior changes are possible, document the invariant and add tests/verification steps.

## Quick Decision Tree

When a developer needs concurrency guidance, follow this decision tree:

1. **Starting fresh with async code?**
   - Read `references/async-await-basics.md` for foundational patterns
   - For parallel operations → `references/tasks.md` (async let, task groups)

2. **Protecting shared mutable state?**
   - Need to protect class-based state → `references/actors.md` (actors, @MainActor)
   - Need thread-safe value passing → `references/sendable.md` (Sendable conformance)

3. **Managing async operations?**
   - Structured async work → `references/tasks.md` (Task, child tasks, cancellation)
   - Streaming data → `references/async-sequences.md` (AsyncSequence, AsyncStream)

4. **Working with legacy frameworks?**
   - Core Data integration → `references/core-data.md`
   - General migration → `references/migration.md`

5. **Performance or debugging issues?**
   - Slow async code → `references/performance.md` (profiling, suspension points)
   - Testing concerns → `references/testing.md` (XCTest, Swift Testing)

6. **Understanding threading behavior?**
   - Read `references/threading.md` for thread/task relationship and isolation

7. **Memory issues with tasks?**
   - Read `references/memory-management.md` for retain cycle prevention

## Triage-First Playbook (Common Errors -> Next Best Move)

- Concurrency-related lint warnings
  - Use `references/linting.md` for rule intent and preferred fixes; avoid dummy awaits as “fixes”.
- `async_without_await` lint warning
  - Remove `async` if not required; if required by protocol/override/@concurrent, prefer narrow suppression over adding fake awaits. See `references/linting.md`.
- "Sending value of non-Sendable type ... risks causing data races"
  - First: identify where the value crosses an isolation boundary
  - Then: use `references/sendable.md` and `references/threading.md` (especially Swift 6.2 behavior changes)
- "Main actor-isolated ... cannot be used from a nonisolated context"
  - First: decide if it truly belongs on `@MainActor`
  - Then: use `references/actors.md` (global actors, `nonisolated`, isolated parameters) and `references/threading.md` (default isolation)
- "Class property 'current' is unavailable from asynchronous contexts" (Thread APIs)
  - Use `references/threading.md` to avoid thread-centric debugging and rely on isolation + Instruments
- "Actor-isolated type does not conform to protocol" (protocol conformance errors)
  - First: determine whether the protocol requirements must execute on the actor (for example, UI work on `@MainActor`) or can safely be `nonisolated`.
  - Then: follow the Quick Fix Playbook entry for actor-isolated protocol conformance and `references/actors.md` for implementation patterns (isolated conformances, `nonisolated` requirements, and escalation steps).
- XCTest async errors like "wait(...) is unavailable from asynchronous contexts"
  - Use `references/testing.md` (`await fulfillment(of:)` and Swift Testing patterns)
- Core Data concurrency warnings/errors
  - Use `references/core-data.md` (DAO/`NSManagedObjectID`, default isolation conflicts)

## Core Patterns Reference

### Concurrency Tool Selection

| Need | Tool | Key Guidance |
|------|------|-------------|
| Single async operation | `async/await` | Default choice for sequential async work |
| Fixed parallel operations | `async let` | Known count at compile time; auto-cancelled on throw |
| Dynamic parallel operations | `withTaskGroup` | Unknown count; structured — cancels children on scope exit |
| Sync → async bridge | `Task { }` | Inherits actor context; use `Task.detached` only with documented reason |
| Shared mutable state | `actor` | Prefer over locks/queues; keep isolated sections small |
| UI-bound state | `@MainActor` | Only for truly UI-related code; justify isolation |

### Common Scenarios

**Network request with UI update**
```swift
Task { @concurrent in
    let data = try await fetchData()
    await MainActor.run { self.updateUI(with: data) }
}
```

**Processing array items in parallel**
```swift
await withTaskGroup(of: ProcessedItem.self) { group in
    for item in items {
        group.addTask { await process(item) }
    }
    for await result in group {
        results.append(result)
    }
}
```

## Swift 6 Migration Quick Guide

Key changes in Swift 6:
- **Strict concurrency checking** enabled by default
- **Complete data-race safety** at compile time
- **Sendable requirements** enforced on boundaries
- **Isolation checking** for all async boundaries

### Migration Validation Loop

Apply this cycle for each migration change:

1. **Build** — Run `swift build` or Xcode build to surface new diagnostics
2. **Fix** — Address one category of error at a time (e.g., all Sendable issues first)
3. **Rebuild** — Confirm the fix compiles cleanly before moving on
4. **Test** — Run the test suite to catch regressions (`swift test` or Cmd+U)
5. **Only proceed** to the next file/module when all diagnostics are resolved

If a fix introduces new warnings, resolve them before continuing. Never batch multiple unrelated fixes — keep commits small and reviewable.

For detailed migration steps, see `references/migration.md`.

## Verification Checklist (When You Change Concurrency Code)

1. Confirm build settings (default isolation, strict concurrency, upcoming features) before interpreting diagnostics.
2. **Build** — Verify the project compiles without new warnings or errors.
3. **Test** — Run tests, especially concurrency-sensitive ones (see `references/testing.md`).
4. **Performance** — If performance-related, verify with Instruments (see `references/performance.md`).
5. **Lifetime** — If lifetime-related, verify deinit/cancellation behavior (see `references/memory-management.md`).
6. Check `Task.isCancelled` in long-running operations.
7. Never use semaphores or locks in async contexts — use actors or `Mutex` instead.
